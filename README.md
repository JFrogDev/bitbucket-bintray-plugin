## JFrog Add-on for Bitbucket Cloud
JFrog has developed an add-on for Atlassianâ€™s BitBucket distributed version control system. The add-on integrates BitBucket with JFrog Artifactory and JFrog Bintray to provide a unified dashboard that visualizes the entire release pipeline - from commit to BitBucket triggering the CI server to run a build, to promotion in Artifactory through the quality gates, until it is released for distribution through Bintray.
